Hi, I'm Kat. I've been leading engineering and technology teams for 15+ years at companies ranging from series A/B/C startups to publicly traded organizations and private equity backed ones. 

Outside of tech, I'm passionate about New York City, exercise, cooking, learning Mandarin, reading, music, and a lot more.
