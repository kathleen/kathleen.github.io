My first steps towards a career as a software engineer started in the late 1990's/early 2000's. That's when I learned HTML, Javascript, and CSS so I could build websites for my favorite shows (Sailor Moon) and my MySpace page. I also spent a lot of time writing in my Livejournal. After diligently updating my Livejournal for ~10 years, life got busy and I stopped. 

Now, 17 years have passed and I find myself with a lot of thoughts on how technology and product development _should_ be done and nowhere to put them so here we are.

I also look forward to sharing my experiences with using AI, both for coding and as a general productivity tool.

So let's give it a go.
